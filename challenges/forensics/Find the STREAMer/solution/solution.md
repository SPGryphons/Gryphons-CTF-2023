# Solution
1. Unzip find_the_streamer.rar using WinRAR (other unzippers may affect the streamed file)
2. Open the extracted folder up in command prompt and run the command dir/r to see the streamed file (streamed.png:streamer.txt)
3. open up streamed.png:streamer.txt in any way (cmd command: streamed.png:streamer.txt) and get the key (lying)
4. use https://futureboy.us/stegano/ or steghide (or whatever other steganography tool works) to decode mem.jpg with the key for the flag
