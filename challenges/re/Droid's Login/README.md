# Droid's Login
Can you find the password Droid uses to log in to his Toolbox?
>>> Enclose it with GCTF23{<password here>}
>>> e.g. If the password is "password123", the flag shall be GCTF23{password123} 
>>> Tip: An Android device is recommended. If you do not have one, you can use the emulator on Android Studio, or you can use GenyMotion.
