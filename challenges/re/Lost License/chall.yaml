  description: A software company had a developer create a program that automatically
    generates a license key for their top client, "Tharman Shanmugaratnam." However,
    they now need to generate a license for another VIP client but lost the original
    source code. Your goal is to reverse engineer the software to understand how the
    license key generation algorithm works and then generate a valid license key for
    the name "Halimah Yacob."

    description: The logic isn't overtly complex, but it does involve bitwise manipulations
      and some mathematical operations. Diving deep into assembly could prove helpful.
