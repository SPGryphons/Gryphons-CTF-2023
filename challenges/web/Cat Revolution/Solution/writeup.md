## Solution
1. The Cat Chat interception in Webpage 1 is Base64 encoded.Use online decoders to decode it.
2. Once you decode it you will realise that its not in English. Its actually in Spanish!! Hint: Maximus is speaking with a SPANISH Cat. After translating it you will get the first part of your flag.
3. The second flag is hidden in the JavaScript source file in the Webpage 2. The flag is once again Base-64 encoded.Decode it to obtain the second part of the flag
4. If you look at the CSS source file of the third webpage you will see an image that actually doesn't appear in the webpage.The image file is named catflag.png.Use a online steganography tool to decode the image to find the third and last part of the flag.
