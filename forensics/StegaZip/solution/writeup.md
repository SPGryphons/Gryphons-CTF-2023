# Solution
1. Look at the [image](./dist/DapperMonke.jpg), you should see that it is a whopping 14mb large. Woah! Noticing this, try and take a look at the hex code to see whats wrong using Hexed.it
2. By looking through the hex code, you realise that the picture wierdly enough contains MORE pictures, with a wierd password at the end of the whole thing
3. Realising this, use WINRAR (or your zip file program of choice) to extract the pictures. Input the password you found earlier to unlock it.
4. Then, Hexed.it the 666th flag, in which you will find the flag at the end of hex code yet again. (I mean, sort by size works to since it has a different size.)
