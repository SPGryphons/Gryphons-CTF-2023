# Lost License
A software company had a developer create a program that automatically generates a license key for their top client, "Tharman Shanmugaratnam." However, they now need to generate a license for another VIP client but lost the original source code. Your goal is to reverse engineer the software to understand how the license key generation algorithm works and then generate a valid license key for the name "Halimah Yacob."

## Hints
- `Since you don't have any control over the input, focus on understanding how the hardcoded name transforms into the output key.` (5 points)
- `The logic isn't overtly complex, but it does involve bitwise manipulations and some mathematical operations. Diving deep into assembly could prove helpful.` (10 points)
- `Think about ASCII values. There's a pattern involved with how the input name is transformed.` (20 points)
